# Multimodal Gene-Brain Integration Project

A unified dashboard for tracking research progress across multiple repositories in the Gene-Brain project.

## Overview

This repository serves as the **central tracking hub** for the Multimodal Gene-Brain Integration Project. Individual team members maintain their own repositories for source code, while this hub aggregates:

- **Commit feeds** (on every push from team repos)
- **Daily logs** (end-of-day summaries, manually published after review)

The GitHub Pages site provides a single view of all team activity.

## Live Dashboard

🔗 **[View the Gene-Brain Hub](https://allison-eunse.github.io/gene-brain/)**

- **[Home](https://allison-eunse.github.io/gene-brain/)** — Project overview & team roster
- **[Commits](https://allison-eunse.github.io/gene-brain/commits.html)** — Latest commits from all team repositories
- **[Daily Logs](https://allison-eunse.github.io/gene-brain/daily.html)** — End-of-day summaries

## Project Goal

We aim to construct a unified representation connecting:
- **DNA** (upstream biological blueprint)
- **Proteomic profiles** (intermediate molecular processes)
- **Brain imaging/phenotypic measurements** (downstream outcomes)

within a shared latent space that is predictive, generative, and interpretable.

## Team & Research Components

## For Team Members (Individual Project Repo Setup)

### 1. Add the commit-sync workflow

Copy `templates/individual-project/sync_commits_to_central.yml` to your repo's `.github/workflows/`.

### 2. Set the required secret

Create a secret named `BIG_REPO_TOKEN` with a PAT that has write access to this central repo.

### 3. (Optional) Publish daily logs

Use `templates/individual-project/publish_today.sh` to push your reviewed `TODAY.md` to the central repo.

### Auto-Discovery

You don't need to tell the central repo your exact repository name. The dashboard will **automatically discover** any project that syncs commits. Projects will appear with their GitHub username and repo name.

To add custom display names (e.g., "Gene-Text" instead of "gene-text"), update `site/config/projects.json`.
